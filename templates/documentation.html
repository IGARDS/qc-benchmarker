        <h2>Documentation</h2>
		<br>
		QC Benchmarker relies on using data generated from a commercial protein digest, and that the data be acquired in a standardized fashion.
		<br>
		While still in beta, only a HeLa digest is supported, but in the future the following will be supported: <br>
		Thermo Scientific HeLa Digest <br>
		Promega Yeast Digest <br>
		Waters <i>E. coli</i> Digest <br>
		<br>
		The recommended loading is 200 ng on column. Prepare the material using the manufacturers suggested protocol. <br>
		The recommended LC gradient for HeLa and Yeast is:
		(if using a trap/elute set-up, the first step is 10 minutes of trapping) <br>
		<br>
		<table style="width:10%">
			<tr>
				<th>Time (min)</th>
				<th>% Acetonitrile</th> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>0</td>
				<td>5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>10</td>
				<td>5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>115</td>
				<td>22</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>130</td>
				<td>32</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>140</td>
				<td>95</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>150</td>
				<td>95</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>150.1</td>
				<td>5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>160</td>
				<td>5</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		There will be a shorter gradient used for <i>E. coli</i> or for ~40 ng loading of HeLa and yeast. <br>
		<br>
		Acquisition settings are given below, and these are not meant to be "best" settings, but are settings known to give certain performance when collecting MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition mode. <br>
		<br>
		<br>What raw file types can be used (along with future support)?<br>
		Since QC Benchmarker relies on msconvert, the following vendor formats are currently supported:<br>
		Thermo <br>
		Agilent <br>
		Bruker <br>
		Sciex <br>
		Shimadzu <br>
		UIMF <br>
		<br>
		Using the information, and caveats on thresholds, emphasizing how each instrument is different.
